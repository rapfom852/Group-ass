This is how our program for quadratic equation solver was designed and codedd;
Interface:
- first, we changed the name of the form ie at/text.
-We changed the background color by importing a picture from local storage.
-we inserted a picture box and added a picture created using paint
- we added labels as a,b and c for the input of the coefficients .
-Next, we added textboxes for the user to input coefficients.
-We added a button as solution.
-Further labels were added for the results/solution.
-We joined them inside group boxes.

Coding:
- We started by declaring the variables.
- We assigned functions to the solution button created
